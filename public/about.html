<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born on August 5th, 1980, in Athens, the youngest of three children. My childhood was a time of simple joys — playing soccer with a soda can, chasing a plastic ball that the wind could carry away, or on lucky days, kicking a real football. We built wooden swords to play war with friends, made slingshots, crafted our own kites, and turned every street corner into a new adventure powered by imagination.</p>

<p>At 14, I took my first job — not out of necessity, but because I loved the freedom of earning my own money. From that day on, I never stopped working. Today, I’m married to the woman of my dreams and the proud father of two wonderful children.</p>

<p>Ever since I was young, I’ve had a passion for games and computers. But because I learned early to work hard and be independent, I never had the chance to formally study the field I truly loved. Now, with more life experience and a clear vision, I’ve decided it’s time to finally take the next step toward the dream I’ve carried with me since childhood.</p>
